# Real-Estate-Investment-Financing-APP
This App was developed for our real estate investment consultation. By inputing purchasing, mortgage, and rental management information, we can directly get results of cap rate, cashflows, and rate of returns in 1-5 years. The 30 year trends of investment returns, equity, property value, and mortgage balance will be shown in plots.

## How to use the APP for real estate investment financial forecasting.
### If we need to choose between two or more investment properties, we can use the APP as follows.
1. Input purchase price and rent of property 1. 
2. Input your downpayment rate, interest rate, and other default assumption numbers if you need. 
3. Click "Calculate". Now you get the valuation results of property 1.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for property 2.
5. Compare the valuation of two investment scenarios, and make your decision based on your investment strategy.

Analysis: At a fixed downpayment rate, cheaper property brings more cashflow, while its value increase is not as good as the other.

### If we need to decide how much downpayment we spend on one specific property, we use the APP as follows.
1. Input downpayment rate of scenario 1.
2. Input all other information about the property.
3. Click "Calculate". Now you get the investment results of scenario 1.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for a different downpayment rate in scenario 2.
5. Compare the valuation of two investment scenarios, and make your decision based on your investment strategy.

Analysis: At a higher downpayment rate (30%) scenario, the cashflow is positive, which is much better than the 10% one (negative). However, its "cumulative return" is much lower than the scenario with 10% downpayment.
